TASK 3

Now that you have your custom kernel up and running, it's time to modify
it!

The tasks for this round is:
  - take the kernel git tree from Task 02 and modify the Makefile to
    and modify the EXTRAVERSION field.  Do this in a way that the
    running kernel (after modifying the Makefile, rebuilding, and
    rebooting) has the characters "-eudyptula" in the version string.
